# Project Description:
Our project offers a user-friendly webUI that brings together latest technologies for easy task execution. Users can effortlessly interact with Docker containers, manage AWS services, set up a Hadoop cluster for storing data across multiple systems, and automate jobs using Jenkins. The backend powered by Python CGI ensures robust functionality.

We've created a smart chatbot using generative AI that engages users in interactive conversations. With computer vision, users can experience real-time face detection, background blur, distance measurement, and volume adjustments for an exciting user interface. Machine learning enables us to train models for various tasks, making this project a powerful and versatile solution for multiple uses.
